# [`pyqoi`](https://github.com/Edward-Knight/pyqoi)

_A pure Python implementation of [QOI - the Quite OK Image format](https://qoiformat.org)._

⚠️ Still in development! ⚠️

The Python library [`qoi`](https://github.com/kodonnell/qoi)
is a wrapper of the C reference implementation,
so is probably both faster and more correct.
